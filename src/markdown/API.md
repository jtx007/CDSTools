This page gives an overview of all PDBTools objects,fuctions and methods. All classes and functions exposed in *PDBTools*. 

PDBTools has its own functions to start computations,compare, and analyze data. These general PDBTool functions are described below:

| Function | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| first_comparison(*args, **kwargs) | compare two amino acid chains |
| second_comparison(*args, **kwargs) | compare two amino acid chains based on the types of amino acids  |
|third_comparison(*args, **kwargs) | locates the selected amino acid |
|distance_1 (*args, **kwargs)      | Calculates the distance from one specific amino acid to the substitution site |
|distance_2(*args, **kwargs) | Calculates the disance from an amino acid site to a range of substitution sites |
|filter_results(*args) | Filters the results returned after the amino acids have been compared. |
